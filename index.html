                    Apptopia provides app publishers & developers access to app intelligence worldwide. We at Create
                    Studio worked closely with Apptopia,

                <p>
                    I was asked to update this page to improve traffic. This means the value needed to be presented more

            <p>
                The user graph page presents two major challenges: a wealth
                of information and it’s complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users need to be able to both scan the page easily, and understand the
                intricate information given to them in as little time and effort as possible.

            <p>
                The most releavant information to our users when trying to optimize app
                advertisement is to understand which other apps their users are likely to install.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the very top of the page users can find the most prevelant app installed within the same category,
                and the top four apps in the overall top 2 categories. This information allows the app creators to
                understand quickly how to tailor their advertisement in a way that is most releavant to their specific
                users.

            <p>
                Next, app creators are given a list of all apps, with a pictogram in each listing representing how
                likely their users are to download this app.<br>
                This feature allows Apptopia to reflect a complex dataset in a simplistic way - just good enough to be
                of value, and simple enough to understand without drilling down further.

                    Bits of Gold is the longest operating Crypto-Fiat exchange in Israel. Last year, I led the redesign
                    of the entire platform. In this case study I will focus on users’ active orders on their personal
                    activity page.

                <p>
                    This area did not exist prior to the redesign.
                    BoG asked to give their users a place to monitor their activity in a way that promotes trust and
                    transparency.

            <p>
                This area needed to be both clear and concise, as well as rich and informative.
            </p>
            <p>
                To maximize transparency and promote trust, I aimed to reflect to the user
                the most urgent information in a simple and intuitive way.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-section">

            <h3 class="sub-title">ACTIVE ORDERS</h3>
            <p>
                Due to government regulations, Crypto-Fiat exchanges can go anywhere from several days to several weeks.
                This means users wait for some time after paying to see the coins reflected in their account.
            </p>
            <p>
                In its minimized form (second order), an active order will present the user only with the most important
                information: what’s happening with their money, and what the next step is. The listing also reflects
                when the order was opened, to eliminate the user’s need to remember how long it’s been. </p>
            <p>
                When expanded, the listing allows the user to delve deeper into the ‘nuts and bolts’ of their active
                orders. In this section I aimed to highlight the most interesting and important information, in an
                easy-to-read format.

                    EZ-Match is a service dedicated to helping businesses and their accountants stay on top of their
                    credit card transaction and fees.
                    In this project we designed a dashboard reflecting information regarding irregular credit
                    transactions, needing attention.

            <h3 class="sub-title">CHALLENGE</h3>
            <p>
                This project presented a challenge in two aspects: first, it’s end users are not proficient with
                technology, and are not likely to adopt change easily. Second, as a personal challenge, this area of
                accounting is esoteric and difficult to understand. Without understanding the material, designing a
                clear and concise interface would be impossible.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title">IRREGULARITIES & LATEST REPORTS</h3>
            <p>
                The most frequently asked questions in the calls made to the EZ-Match account managers surrounded
                information regarding businesses’ irregular transactions: cancellations, corrupt credit terminals, fraud
                and more. To help accountants clear their workload without needing to call their account manager I
                decided to show them only their irregular transactions, in a minimalist way. No redundant, cluttered
                information and no complex, endless excel tables.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another area which created an immense amount of calls are reports generated and sent to businesses via
                email. Because of the medium (email), users tended to lose the reports in a sea of daily mail. This had
                an easy fix: allow the users to view and download their latest reports on-demand.

            <h3 class="sub-title">IN-PROGRESS CASES & UPCOMING REPORTS</h3>
            <p>
                Another much needed feature involved upcoming reports. During interviews on-premise, account managers
                reported they were constantly bombarded with emails and phone calls asking when a specific report will
                be delivered. While reports need to be validated for accuracy and quality, report publishing is a
                cyclical event, and an approximate shipping date for each type of report is usually known in advance. I
                decided to display the approximate release dates in the accountants’ dashboard, for an easy fix to a
                painful problem.
