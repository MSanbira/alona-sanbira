                    I was asked to update this page to improve traffic. This means the value needed to be presented more

            <p>
                The user graph page presents two major challenges: a wealth
                of information and it’s complexity.<br>
                This page was underused, and following conversations with users,
                we realised there were two major issues: users didn’t understand the information presented, and as a
                result, they felt this page gave them very little value. The way information was shown forced users to
                work hard for something they didn’t understand to begin with.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users need to be able to both scan the page easily, and understand the intricate information given to
                them in as little time and effort as possible.

            <p>
                To tackle this issue, I first needed to deeply understand what this data meant and what it stood for. As
                an outsider to the product, I needed to gain an understanding that was good enough to make good UX
                decisions, but I also needed to gain this knowledge very quickly, as I was given just a handful of hours
                to create a solution from start to visual design handoff.<br>
                My research consisted mainly of in-depth conversations with the company’s lead PM (users were not
                available to me), and trying to use the platform and specific page until I felt I understood it’s core
                value to users. Sometimes, time constraints mean having to rely on others in the product space for
                information, so I needed to be able to enlist the lead PM to this process, even though the PM is busy
                and overwhelmed with an enormous amount of tasks.

            <p>
                The most relevant information to our users when trying to optimize app advertisement is to understand
                which other apps their users are likely to install.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the very top of the page users can find the most prevalent app installed within the same category,
                and the top four apps in the overall top 2 categories. This information allows the app creators to
                understand quickly how to tailor their advertisement in a way that is most relevant to their specific
                users.

            <h3 class="sub-title">OVERLAPPING APPS - ALL</h3>
            <p>
                Next, app creators are given a list of all apps, with a pictogram in each listing representing how
                likely their users are to download this app.<br>
                This feature allows Apptopia to reflect a complex dataset in a simplistic way - just good enough to be
                of value, and simple enough to understand without drilling down further.

                    Bits of Gold is the longest operating Crypto-Fiat exchange in Israel. Last year, I led the redesign
                    of the entire platform. In this case study I will focus on users’ active orders on their personal
                    activity page.

            <p>
                This area in the legacy site was confusing and hard to navigate to.
                Users of digital currencies are normally suspicious to begin with, using extreme measures of security
                when it comes to their money.<br>
                Knowing this, I aimed to give our users a sense of control over their transactions with BoG.
            </p>
            <p>
                This area needed to be both clear and concise, as well as rich and informative.
            </p>
            <p>
                To maximize transparency and promote trust, I aimed to reflect to the user
                the most urgent information in a simple and intuitive way.<br>
                Users can easily understand the nature of the transaction (buying or selling), how much they paid in
                exchange rates and fees and when the money is due in their account.

            <h3 class="sub-title">RESEARCH</h3>
            <p>
                While designing the platform I spoke with both BoG users and potential users (those who knew of BoG but
                have decided against using the platform). During these conversations I tried to understand what drives
                users’ decisions whether or not to buy digital currency and specifically what drives the decision to use
                the BoG platform.<br>
                I spoke to 20 users, most of them male, under 45, from the Tel-Aviv area - a choice I made after diving
                into the current platform’s user data analytics.
                I also led a competitors research, to deeply understand and answer the question: what does a
                digital-fiat currency exchange look like in 2018? What should it look like? What should it encompass and
                what do users need?
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title">ACTIVE ORDERS</h3>
            <p>
                Due to government regulations, Crypto-Fiat transactions can take anywhere from several days to several
                weeks to complete. This means users wait for some time after paying to see the coins reflected in their
                account.
            </p>
            <p>
                In its minimized form (second order), an active order will present the user only with the most important
                information: what’s happening with their money, and what the next step is. The listing also reflects
                when the order was opened, to eliminate the user’s need to remember how long it’s been.
            </p>
            <p>
                When expanded, the listing allows the user to delve deeper into the ‘nuts and bolts’ of their active
                orders. In this section I aimed to highlight the most interesting and important information, in an
                easy-to-read format.

                    In this project we designed a dashboard reflecting information regarding irregular credit

                This project presented a challenge in two aspects: first, it’s end users are not proficient with
                technology, and are not likely to adopt change easily. Second, as a personal challenge, this area of
                accounting is esoteric and difficult to understand. Without understanding the material, designing a
                clear and concise interface would be impossible.

            <h3 class="sub-title">RESEARCH</h3>
            <p>
                To understand the needs and painpoints deeply, I spoke to all links in the chain of service at EZ-match
                - management, junior management, account managers and customers.<br>
                Research included two full days of talking to people and listening in on calls made to th EZ-match call
                center.<br>
                After talking with users, I tried to find inspiration in all kinds of report-creation systems and
                complex
                interfaces in different fields from HR and benefit management to financial management tools and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was given many Excel tables that needed to be represented in this new interface, so my focus became
                trying to figure out what was the most relevant and critical information? What is relevant but
                non-critical? What needs to be left out?<br>
                In this space, I felt it was critical to understand what kind of interface would the “good enogh”
                product be, delivering high value to users at minimal cost to developers, as a starting point from which
                data could be collected to improve and expand the app.

            <h3 class="sub-title">IRREGULARITIES & LATEST REPORTS</h3>
            <p>
                The most frequently asked questions in the calls made to the EZ-Match account managers surrounded
                information regarding businesses’ irregular transactions: cancellations, corrupt credit terminals, fraud
                and more. To help accountants clear their workload without needing to call their account manager I
                decided to show them only their irregular transactions, in a minimalist way. No redundant, cluttered
                information and no complex, endless Excel tables.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another area which created an immense amount of calls are reports generated and sent to businesses via
                email. Because of the medium (email), users tended to lose the reports in a sea of daily mail. This had
                an easy fix: allow the users to view and download their latest reports on-demand.

                Another much needed feature involved upcoming reports. During interviews on-premise, account managers
                reported they were constantly being bombarded with emails and phone calls asking when a specific report
                will be delivered. While reports need to be validated for accuracy and quality, report publishing is a
                cyclical event, and an approximate shipping date for each type of report is usually known in advance. I
                decided to display the approximate release dates in the accountants’ dashboard, for an easy fix to a
                painful problem.
